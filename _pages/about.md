I am many things outside of my professional background. Allow me to give you a glimpse into who I am, and if you are interested in my professional experience, please check out my CV and publication page for more information.

* I am a Uyghur, and I can make a pretty solid hand-pulled noodles dish.
* I have a strong family value, my loved ones are very important to me.
* I have two adorable cats and they are my pride and joy.
* I am a firm believer that financial literacy should be taught early on, so I make sure to teach my cats about budgeting and saving for their catnip fund.
* My favorite quotes are "live the pursuit of growth" and "a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one".
* I enjoy mentoring others, as I believe that sharing knowledge is the best way to multiply it.
* Dancing is my therapy, and I used to compete at collegiate level ballroom competitions.
* I usually start my morning at the gym with weight training.
